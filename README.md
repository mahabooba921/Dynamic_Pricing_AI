# Dynamic Pricing using Reinforcement Learning

An AI-based dynamic pricing system that learns optimal pricing strategies using reinforcement learning to maximize long-term revenue.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an autonomous AI decision-making system for dynamic pricing.  
A reinforcement learning agent interacts with a simulated market environment and learns how to adjust prices based on demand and inventory conditions in order to maximize total revenue over time.

Unlike traditional machine learning models that rely on historical labeled data, this system learns through continuous interaction with the environment using reward-based feedback.

## 🧠 Why This Project?
Dynamic pricing is widely used in industries such as e-commerce, airlines, ride-hailing, and hotels.  
This project demonstrates how **Reinforcement Learning (AI)** can be applied to pricing problems where decisions directly impact future outcomes.

## 🔁 How the System Works
- The environment simulates market conditions such as demand and inventory.
- The agent observes the current state and selects a pricing action.
- The environment returns a reward based on revenue.
- The agent updates its Q-values using the Q-learning algorithm.
- Over multiple episodes, the agent learns an optimal pricing strategy.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
python visualize.py

## 📈 Output
After training, the system generates revenue values for each episode and saves them in a NumPy file.
A visualization is created to show how total revenue improves over training episodes, demonstrating that the agent learns an optimal pricing strategy over time.

## 🤖 AI vs ML Explanation
This project is categorized as Artificial Intelligence (AI) because it uses Reinforcement Learning, where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards.
No labeled dataset is used, and decisions are optimized through trial and error rather than prediction.

## 💼 Interview Summary
This project demonstrates autonomous decision-making, reinforcement learning implementation, and real-world applicability in dynamic pricing and demand control systems.
